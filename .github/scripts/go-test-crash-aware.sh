# go-test-crash-aware.sh runs a test suite through gotestsum and tells a Go
# runtime crash apart from a failing test.
#
# Usage:
#   go-test-crash-aware.sh <json-dir> [-flag=value ...] <packages ...>
#
# Flags are passed to `go test` as written and must carry their value in the
# same word (-timeout=30m, not -timeout 30m), because the packages are told
# from the flags by their first character and run again on their own.
#
# The first run is `gotestsum --jsonfile <json-dir>/first.json -- <args>`.
# Its go test -json stream is then read back. A package whose output carries
# one of the signatures below is a crashed package; a package with a fail
# event and no signature is a failing package, whether a test failed, the
# build broke or TestMain gave up. Failing packages fail the run, as they
# always did, and are listed with their failing tests. Crashed packages are
# run once more, alone: one that passes is reported as a runtime crash in
# the log and in the job summary and does not fail the run, one that crashes
# or fails again does.
#
# Why. A Go test suite on the hosted Windows runners dies inside the Go
# runtime now and then, whatever the code under test does, and golang/go#81238
# explains it: on hosts with Intel AMX, recovering a hardware exception on a
# goroutine stack lets Windows write its exception context below the stack into
# the heap, and the next garbage collection faults. The hosted pool is
# heterogeneous, so the same commit crashes on one runner and passes on the
# next. This script is jmrplens/gitlab-mcp-server's, whose Windows leg met the
# crash first, and it is here for the same three reasons it was written there:
# rerunning the whole job by hand tells nobody anything, failing on the crash
# blocks merges on a bug nobody here can fix, and ignoring the leg lets a real
# Windows regression pass as one more flake. This keeps the distinction, and
# keeps a record of every crash where a reader looks for one.
#
# A crash is a "fatal error:" line from the runtime, minus the messages the
# runtime uses for a bug in the code under test. The first version of this
# script named the corruption messages instead (a fault, a pointer to a free
# object, a bad pointer in the heap) and the third crash seen was none of
# them: "acquireSudog: found s.elem != nil in cache", the sudog cache's own
# consistency check tripping over the same corrupted heap. A corrupted heap
# trips whichever runtime invariant reads it first, so the list can never be
# complete; the list of things the runtime says about a bug in user code is
# short and stable, and that is the one kept. "panic: runtime error" is never
# a crash: an unrecovered nil dereference is a bug in the code under test.
