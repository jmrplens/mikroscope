.SYNOPSIS
  Puts the mikroscope binary on this machine.

.DESCRIPTION
  The Windows half of install.sh, with the same promise: work out the
  architecture, resolve a version, download that archive and the release's
  checksum file, and refuse to install anything whose SHA-256 is not the one
  the release published. There is no switch to skip that. A script piped into
  a shell is the least inspectable way to install anything, so the one thing it
  must not do is trust what it just downloaded.

  Written for Windows PowerShell 5.1 as well as PowerShell 7, because 5.1 is
  the one already on the machine: no null-coalescing, no ternaries, no
  three-argument Join-Path, and TLS 1.2 asked for explicitly, which 5.1 on an
  older Windows does not default to.
